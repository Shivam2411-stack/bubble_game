                        Welcome to the Bubble Game! In this game, your goal is to score as many points as possible by
                        clicking on bubbles. The challenge is simple but fast-paced: click on the bubbles as quickly as
                        you can within the 60-second time limit. Each bubble you hit will add 10 points to your score,
                        so make sure to hit as many bubbles as you can before the time runs out!
<br><br>
                        The game begins with a 60-second countdown, and you can track your progress with the timer and
                        score displayed at the top. As the game progresses, your score will increase with every hit.
                        Precision and speed are key to achieving the highest possible score. When the timer reaches
                        zero, the game will end, and your final score will be shown on the screen.
<br><br>
                        Features of the Game:
<br>
                        The game starts with a clear 60-second timer.
                        Each bubble click rewards you with 10 points.
                        You can see your hits, timer, and score in real-time at the top of the screen.
                        The faster and more accurate you are, the higher your score will be.
                         Good luck!
